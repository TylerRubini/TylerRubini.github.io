<!-- I honestly don't have a ton of photos that I've taken on my current phone, but the theme of my gallery became obvious when I realized that I had five pet images to share. -->
<h1>Tyler Rubini's Official Website</h1>
<h2>Pet Gallery</h2>
<p class="photo">On this page, you will find photos of the various animals in my life.</p>

<!-- I decided that the gallery would look better centred, so I implemented divs around each photo/caption pair and centred the entire div using CSS, as described in this article: 
     https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-center-an-image-in-css/ 
     I have also used CSS to set each image to display at its native resolution using either a class or ID, with guidance taken from https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_dimension.asp -->
  
<!-- ImageOption Begin -->
<!-- I used a class instead of an ID to set the native resolution here because the first three images have the same dimensions -->
<div class="photo">
<img src="ellie.jpg" alt="Ellie" class="img1to3">
<p>My brother's cat, Ellie</p>
</div>

<div class="photo">
<img src="toby.jpg" alt="Toby" class="img1to3">
<p>My brother's other cat, Toby</p>
</div>

<div class="photo">
<img src="sassy.jpg" alt="Sassy" class="img1to3">
<p>My roommate's cat, Sassy</p>
</div>

<!-- This image and the final one have different dimensions from the first three and one another, so I've used IDs to set the native resolution -->
<div class="photo">
<img src="hector.jpg" alt="Hector" id="img4">
<p>My neighbour's cat, Hector</p>
</div>
  
<div class="photo">
<img src="icestorm.jpg" alt="Ice and Storm" id="img5">
<p>My mom's two dogs, Ice and Storm</p>
</div>
