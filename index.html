<!-- I decided to use a three-header size heirarchy for this website. h1 is used only for the overall website header, h2 is used for section headers, and h3 is used for 
subheadings within the body of my resume. h2 headers are underlined for visual emphasis and because context makes it fairly clear that they are not links. -->
<h1>Tyler Rubini's Official Website</h1>
<h2>Who am I?</h2>

<p>My name is Tyler Rubini and I am a current student in Fleming College's Geographic Information Systems post-graduate program. I expect to graduate in June of 2024 
    and then seek employment in the GIS industry. I already possess an Honours B.A. in Geography and Environmental Studies and I am very excited to add a post-graduate 
    certificate on top of that. While I have extensive retail experience, I'm looking forward to moving into a new career that will allow me to apply my interests in mapping 
    and geography on a regular basis. While I've spent most of my life living in Hamilton and I would ideally like to move back there once I'm finished school, I would 
    consider relocating to any part of Canada for my post-educational career.</p>

<p>Outside of my professional life, I have an array of interests and hobbies. These include cycling, reading, going to the theatre, attending comedy shows, 
    playing/running tabletop role-playing games (such as Dungeons and Dragons), and collecting/applying nail polish. Beyond that, I enjoy spending time with my family in Hamilton, 
    which consists of my dad, two brothers, and a sister. I also have a mom and stepdad, who recently moved to rural New Brunswick, and several family cats, including one 
    here in Lindsay that belongs to my roommate.</p>

<!-- I wasn't sure what aspect of my life I could use for a chart, but then I realized that I've attended quite a few schools and the inspiration flowed from there. I decided to 
create a five column chart showing all the directly comparable data across the six institutions I've attended since high school. I have assigned each an ID in order to apply CSS mouse-over
colouration representing elements of each school's official colours. Design guidance was obtained via https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_tables.asp -->
