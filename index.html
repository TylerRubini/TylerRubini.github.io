<h1>Tyler Rubini: An Introduction</h1>

<p>My name is Tyler Rubini and I am a current student in Fleming College's Geographic Information Systems post-graduate program. I expect to graduate in June of 2024 
    and then seek employment in the GIS industry. I already possess an Honours B.A. in Geography and Environmental Studies and I am very excited to add a post-graduate 
    certificate on top of that. While I have extensive retail experience, I'm looking forward to moving into a new career that will allow me to apply my interests in mapping 
    and geography on a regular basis. While I've spent most of my life living in Hamilton and I would ideally like to move back there once I'm finished school, I would 
    consider relocating to any part of Canada for my post-educational career.</p>

<p>Outside of my professional life, I have an array of other interests and hobbies. These include cycling, reading, going to the theatre, attending comedy shows, 
    playing/running tabletop role-playing games (such as Dungeons and Dragons), and collecting/applying nail polish. I have included some photos of that last one on 
    the gallery page, if anyone is interested in seeing my work. I also enjoy spending time with my family in Hamilton, which consists of my dad, two brothers, and a 
    sister. I also have a mom and stepdad, who recently moved to rural New Brunswick, and several family cats, who I have also pictured in the gallery.</p>
