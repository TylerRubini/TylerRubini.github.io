<!-- I decided to use a three-header size hierarchy for this website. h1 is used only for the overall website header, h2 is used for section headers, and h3 is used for 
     subheadings within the body of my resume. I expect that this hierarchy will make it simple for a new user to visually follow the website's content.

<h2>Who am I?</h2>

<!-- This intro is more or less intended to serve as a short, relatively casual cover letter. As such, I've just placed the text into two simple paragraph blocks.
     I made sure to split the text in half by using two tags because it avoids creating a so-called "wall of text", which is difficult and unpleasant for users to read. -->
<p>My name is Tyler Rubini and I am a current student in Fleming College's Geographic Information Systems post-graduate program. I expect to graduate in June of 2024 and then seek employment in the Canadian 
    GIS industry. I possess an Honours B.A. in Geography and Environmental Studies and I am very excited to add a valuable post-graduate certificate on top of that. I have extensive retail experience, having 
    spent nine years working primarily as an evening receiver at Rona (formerly Lowes) in Hamilton, where my supervisors regarded me as a very valuable employee. However, I decided that it was the right time 
    to continue my education, which lead to me resigning in August 2023 to attend Fleming. I'm looking forward to moving into a new career that will allow me to apply knowledge of mapping and geography on a 
    regular basis.</p>

<p>Outside of my professional life, I have an array of interests and hobbies. These include cycling, reading, going to the theatre, attending comedy shows, playing/running tabletop role-playing games (such 
    as Dungeons and Dragons), and collecting/applying nail polish. I was born, raised, and normally live on the Niagara Escarpment in Hamilton (known locally as "the Mountain"), a reasonably walkable suburb 
    with very good public transit access and a vast array of easily-accessible hiking and biking trails. This makes it very easy to get out and enjoy the outdoors, which I try to do as much as possible. 
    Beyond that, I enjoy spending time with my family, which consists of my dad, two brothers, and a sister. I also have my mom and stepdad, who recently moved to rural New Brunswick after over a decade in 
    Brantford, and there are several family cats at home as well.</p>

<h3>Education:</h3>

<!-- I wasn't sure what aspect of my life I could use for this option, but then I realized that I've attended quite a few schools and that I could easily communicate that info in a table.
     I have created a five column table showing directly comparable data across the six institutions I've attended since high school.
     I have assigned each an ID in order to apply CSS mouse-over colouration representing elements of each school's official colours, with CSS guidance from https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_table.asp, 
     https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_table_align.asp, and https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_table_style.asp.
     CSS colour code for Kelly Green was obtained from https://cssgradient.io/shades-of-green/
     HTML design guidance was obtained from https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_tables.asp -->

<h3> Employment and Volunteering:</h3>
    
<!-- I have inserted external links to each organization I have done work for in the past. I assigned each of them the same ID so that I could use CSS to alter their coloration 
     relative to internal links. I have inserted a manual line break after the first line of each entry to provide a simple method of visually separating the position title, employer, 
     and date/location from the description of job duties. I hope that this is considered an acceptable use of br, as it is only a single tag being used for an actual line break, 
     rather than being used consecutively to force white space or replace margins -->
